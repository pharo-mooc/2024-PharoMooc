# Some testimonies
- "I have just completed week seven of the Pharo Mooc \(beginner and object oriented tracks\) I am starting a redo of the Mooc with the web track \(TinyBlog project\). I have already learned so much ! I have spent the last 20 years or so in software development and, following this Mooc, I realized I hadn’t really grasped the essence of object oriented design. - Anonymous“
- "I just completed the @pharoproject Mooc the best investment I have ever made of my time. MAQBOOL"

# Some testimonies
- "Really one of the best mooc I have ever attended. And I have attended quite a few \(openSAP, openHPI\). As an old fashioned ABAP developer I want to be reborn as Pharo developer in my next life :-\) - Anonymous”
- "A general comment I wanted to make is that the MOOC so far has been great. Impressed with the quality and content, and grateful that it is available and free. Many thanks! - Aryeh"
