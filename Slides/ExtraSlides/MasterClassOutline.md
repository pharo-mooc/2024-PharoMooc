# What Mooc followers are saying
_I have just completed week seven of the Pharo Mooc \(beginner and object oriented tracks\) I am starting a redo of the Mooc with the web track \(TinyBlog project\). I have already learned so much ! I have spent the last 20 years or so in software development and, following this Mooc, I realized I hadnâ€™t really grasped the essence of object oriented design. Anonymous_
