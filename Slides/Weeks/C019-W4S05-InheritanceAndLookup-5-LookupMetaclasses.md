The mechanism is **exactly** the same# Only One Lookup Rule<!columns|width=100<!column|width=40The lookup starts in the **class** of the **receiver** then:- if the method is defined in the class, it is returned- otherwise the search continues in the superclass!><!column|width=50![](figures/LookupEssenceWithDoesNotUnderstand.png width=100)!>!># A Class is an Instance of Another ClassClass `X` is always the unique instance of the class `X class`:- `Node` is a class and an object- each object is an instance of a class- the class of `Node` is `Node class`- the class `Node class` is automatically created![](figures/ClassMetaclass.png width=100)# Superclass Chain![](figures/WorkstationMetaclassesWithInheritance.png width=120)# Lookup of Class Methods is No Different![](figures/WorkstationMetaclassesWithInheritanceWithLookup.png width=140)# What You Should Know- A class is an object- A class can receive messages- Method lookup is exactly the same as for all objects:  - go to the class of the receiver   - follow inheritance chain- More during the lecture _Understanding Metaclasses_%  Local Variables:%  compile-command: "cd ../.. && ./compile.sh --to='Beamer' Slides/Week4/C019-W4S05-InheritanceAndLookup-5-LookupMetaclasses.pillar"%  End:
