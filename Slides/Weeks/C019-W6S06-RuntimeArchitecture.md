Pharo code is compiled to bytecodes \(platform neutral instructions\)1. The virtual machine dynamically transforms bytecodes to assembly# Virtual Machine- Pharo.exe, Pharo.app... are the virtual machines- There are two modes:  - from command-line or in interactive \(UI\) mode- It executes compiled code / generates on the fly assembly- Compiled code is packaged/stored in an _image_ \(memory snapshot\)- The virtual machine only needs the _image_ to execute programs# Image Files: Memory Snapshots<!columns|width=100<!column|width=60_.image_ files is a cache of objects:- Simple objects \(points, strings ...\)- But also **compiled** classes and **compiled** methods- Each time we save the image, all objects are saved to disc- At startup we get back all the objects we saved- PC \(program counter\) is also saved and restored  - frozen execution is restarted at launch time!><!column|width=50![](figures/File-VirtualMachineAndImages.png width=160)!>!># Change Files: Change Tape_.changes_ file is a tape of all the changes performed to the system- Logs class creation/deletion, method addition/removal, actions...- Used to browse versions- Can replay/undo actions**A change is associated to an image**- To display class/method definition, tools look in the changes file associated to the current image# Image/Change Files- A change is associated to an image- Image contains all the objects in binary form. Can be executed without the changes file- Changes file simply contains the textual representation of the changes made to the image![](figures/File-VirtualMachineAndImageChange.png width=85)# Save your code using a package and version control system- Change and image are handy to develop- But **they are not a software engineering artefact**- Always have a loading script that takes an image, load your code, run the tests, build your application- Usually  - save code using a Version Control System \(monticello, git\)  - use an integration server to build automatically applications# About the Source/Changes Files<!columns|width=100<!column|width=40_PharoXX.sources_- Contains the _textual_ definition of **system** classes and predefined objects- Is read-only- Created during release of new Pharo versions- Shared to all the users \(images\)!><!column|width=60![](figures/File-ImageAtT0.png width=140)!>!># When you Define New Classes<!columns|width=100<!column|width=40During development or code loading- New objects are compiled in the image- New definitions are added to the changes file- Still you can browse the definition of the system class \(stored in the _PharoXX.sources_\)!><!column|width=60![](figures/File-ImageAtT1.png width=140)!>!># Change Management- Tools>Code Changes  - relies on the changes file and the recording mechanism  - support replay changes- Tools>Iceberg  - Integration with Git and other modern distributed version control systems- New ways to produce images \(e.g. Bootstrapping\)# Conclusion- Powerful deployment- Fast boot-time- Support micro commits- Modern version control
